# Titanic-EDA

The titanic dataset is a brilliant dataset to visualise and understand data and their relationships. I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis to have a better understanding of the data by following these steps:

### Step 0: Importing and reading data
### Step 1: Data Understanding
### Step 2: Data Preparation
### Step 3: Feature Understanding
### Step 4: Feature Relationships

I have also derived conclusions where ever necessary.
